Ambrosia is designed specifically for small businesses, it is a tool to unplug from the fiat matrix and conduct commerce entirely on your own terms.

Ambrosia is an open-source, local-first, and subscription-free Point of Sale (POS) system. It provides a self-sovereign stack by integrating business management tools directly with a self-custodial Lightning Network node (Phoenixd), ensuring full data ownership and eliminating reliance on third-party custodians or payment processors.

## Project Proposal
